## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document describes what the BlindGuide AI application needs to do. It serves as a contract between the development team and stakeholders about the expected functionality.

### 1.2 Scope

BlindGuide AI is a navigation assistance application for visually impaired users. It runs on smartphones and uses the camera to detect obstacles, warning users through voice, sound, and vibration.

The application will:
- Detect common obstacles automatically
- Warn users before they encounter hazards
- Identify stairs, doors, and other important features
- Accept voice commands for additional information
- Work on both iOS and Android devices

The application will not:
- Provide turn-by-turn navigation directions
- Replace a white cane or guide dog entirely
- Work in complete darkness
- Detect every possible hazard

### 1.3 Definitions

**Obstacle**: Any object that could impede walking or cause injury.

**Detection**: The process of identifying an object in the camera view.

**Alert**: A warning delivered to the user through voice, sound, or vibration.

**Walking Path**: The central portion of the camera view where the user is likely to walk.

**Confidence**: A percentage indicating how certain the system is about a detection.

---

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

BlindGuide AI is a standalone application that runs in a web browser on a smartphone. It uses the phone's built-in camera, speakers, and vibration motor. For advanced features, it connects to cloud AI services over the internet.

The application does not require any additional hardware or accessories.

### 2.2 User Classes

**Primary Users: Blind and Visually Impaired Individuals**
- Cannot see the screen
- Rely entirely on audio and haptic feedback
- Need automatic protection without manual intervention
- May have varying levels of technology experience

**Secondary Users: Caregivers and Family Members**
- May help with initial setup
- Can see the screen
- May use the app to understand what the user is experiencing

### 2.3 Operating Environment

- Modern smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- iOS 14 or later, Android 8 or later
- Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or Edge browser
- Rear-facing camera
- Internet connection (for AI features)

### 2.4 Assumptions

- Users will hold the phone with the camera facing forward
- The environment has sufficient lighting for camera-based detection
- Users understand basic smartphone interactions (tapping, swiping)
- Users can hear spoken alerts or feel vibration alerts

**REQ-6.1**: The system shall begin automatic protection immediately after startup and permission grant.

**REQ-6.2**: The protection loop shall pause when the app is backgrounded and resume when foregrounded.

**REQ-6.3**: Users shall be able to pause and resume automatic alerts via voice command or gesture.
