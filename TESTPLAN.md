## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document describes how we tested BlindGuide AI to make sure it works correctly and safely. Since this app is designed to protect visually impaired people from obstacles, thorough testing is especially important.

### 1.2 Scope

We tested:
- Object detection accuracy
- Distance estimation accuracy
- Alert system functionality
- Voice command recognition
- User interface responsiveness
- Performance on various devices
- Actual usability with blind testers

We did not test:
- Long-term reliability (more than 30 days)
- Extreme weather conditions
- Every possible smartphone model

### 1.3 Test Environment

Primary test device: iPhone 14 Pro running iOS 17  
Secondary test device: Samsung Galaxy S23 running Android 14  
Desktop testing: Chrome 120 on macOS  
Network: Standard WiFi connection  
Location: Indoor office environment with controlled lighting

---

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1 Testing Approach

We used a combination of testing methods:

**Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions to make sure they work correctly in isolation. For example, testing that the distance estimation function returns expected values for known inputs.

**Integration Testing**: Testing that components work together correctly. For example, testing that when the detection system finds an obstacle, the alert system receives the correct information.

**System Testing**: Testing the entire application end-to-end. For example, placing an actual chair in front of the camera and verifying the complete alert sequence.

**User Acceptance Testing**: Having real visually impaired users test the application in realistic scenarios.

### 2.2 What We Looked For

For each feature, we checked:
- Does it work at all? (Basic functionality)
- Does it work correctly? (Accuracy)
- Does it work fast enough? (Performance)
- Does it fail gracefully? (Error handling)
- Is it usable by the target audience? (Accessibility)

### 2.3 Pass/Fail Criteria

A test passes if the actual behavior matches the expected behavior within acceptable tolerances. For example:
- Distance estimates within 0.5 meters of actual distance: Pass
- Distance estimates more than 0.5 meters off: Fail

- All obstacles detected and avoided
- Average completion time: 45 seconds
- No collisions

**Scenario B: Stair Approach**

Task: Walk toward a staircase and stop when warned.

Results:
- All 5 participants stopped safely
- Warnings received at appropriate distance (2-3 meters)
- One participant noted "Perfect timing - I had time to prepare"

**Scenario C: Voice Command Usage**

Task: Use voice commands to describe the environment.

Results:

- Most participants found commands intuitive
- One participant had difficulty in noisy environment

### 6.3 User Feedback

**Positive Comments:**

"This is exactly what I've been looking for. It warns me before I hit things, not after." - P1

"The automatic mode is brilliant. I don't have to remember to scan." - P3

"I love that the beeps tell me which direction the obstacle is." - P2

"The stair warnings are incredibly valuable. Falls on stairs are my biggest fear." - P5

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

"Would like faster speech option" - P4

"Could the alerts be louder for outdoor use?" - P3

"Battery life is a concern for longer trips" - P1

### 6.4 User Acceptance

## 7. Issues Found and Fixed

### 7.1 Issues During Development

| Issue | Severity | Description | Resolution |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Voice cutoff | Low | Last word sometimes cut off | Added delay before speech end |
| Double alerts | Medium | Same alert spoke twice | Improved deduplication logic |
| AI timeout | Medium | Slow networks caused hang | Added 5 second timeout |
| Help too fast | Low | Help text spoken too quickly | Reduced speech rate for help |
| Vibration spam | Low | Continuous vibration annoying | Added cooldown period |

### 7.2 Current Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Workaround |
|-------|----------|------------|
| iPad vibration | Low | iPad lacks vibration motor; audio alerts work |
| Bright sunlight | Low | Camera struggles; shade phone slightly |
| Noisy environments | Medium | Voice commands harder; use touch instead |

### 7.3 Issues Not Fixed (Acceptable Limitations)

- Detection accuracy decreases beyond 4 meters (expected behavior)
- Battery usage is significant (inherent to continuous camera use)
- AI features require internet (by design; local detection works offline)
